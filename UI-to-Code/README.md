# UI to Code
Navigating around Internet I found this cool series of posts called "[Can you code this UI concept?](https://stories.uplabs.com/can-you-code-this-ui-concept-9e4ba76b437e#.ucur0sn67)" by [UpLabs](https://www.uplabs.com) in which developers make designs come to life as prototypes. So, inspired on that topic I made this repo to have fun and code some challenging UI concepts with HTML, CSS and Javascript(if necessary), I will also be pointing some of the tricks used in those challenges as a guide to everyone and as a reminder for the future me.

### Concept 1: JUUCE App
This is a product card concept for IOS, I found it at UpLabs and the credit for the design is to [Sergii Petakh](https://dribbble.com/sergiipetakh). Here is the [Concept](https://ios.uplabs.com/posts/juuce-app-product-card-animation), here's the [Pen](http://codepen.io/emoreno911/pen/vyJvpB) and here are the [:books: Details](/juuce_app/README.md).

### Concept 2: NEWS App
A news app concept inspired by [Jaret Zen](https://dribbble.com/JaretZen), here you can transition between the featured news by swipping right or left, or by clicking on any of the slider indicators, if you swipeup on a featured article the app will show you more news for that source. Here is the [Concept](https://material.uplabs.com/posts/news-app-4b47c474-3bfb-4f75-872c-70c26637f25c), here's the [Pen](http://codepen.io/emoreno911/pen/BQMYja) and here are the [:books: Details](/news_app/README.md).

### Concept 3: Material Music
UIToCode is back in town and it comes supercharged with this music app concept from [Vitaly Silkin](https://material.uplabs.com/posts/material-music). It's supercharged because I add some UI and UX improvements to make this good design even better and it's also fully functional. Here is the [Concept](https://material.uplabs.com/posts/material-music), here's the [Pen](http://codepen.io/emoreno911/pen/zNMOew) and here are the [:books: Details](/material_music/README.md).

### Concept 4: Shoe Shop
An eshop inspired by [Youssef Eid](https://site.uplabs.com/youssefeid), to this cool design I have added a carousel with 3D transitons when you navigate between shop items. You can also add items to the cart. Here is the [Concept](https://site.uplabs.com/posts/yeezy-boost), here's the [Pen](https://codepen.io/emoreno911/pen/Gmjgvb) and here are the [:books: Details](/shoe_shop/README.md).
